# Introduction

Co-expression network analysis with RNA-Seq data provides insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression. We can find functional relationships, identify important regulatory genes, and discover biological pathways by analyzing the correlation patterns between gene expression profiles across diverse situations. This method enables the discovery of co-regulated genes that may be implicated in shared biological processes or pathways, providing a comprehensive understanding of gene expression dynamics. Furthermore, co-expression networks provide a systematic framework for selecting candidate genes for additional experimental validation, making it possible to uncover novel biomarkers in a variety of biological situations.

## Dirichlet process and Gaussian process (DPGP)

Dirichlet and Gaussian process models have emerged as promising tools for capturing temporal dependencies and dynamic interactions among genes in co-expression network research using time series data. Dirichlet process models provide a versatile non-parametric framework for clustering genes into co-expression modules while supporting different cluster sizes and architectures. Gaussian process models, on the other hand, offer a robust probabilistic framework for modeling time-varying gene expression trajectories, incorporating both deterministic and stochastic variations. Integrating these Bayesian modeling tools with RNA-Seq time series data allows for the identification of dynamic gene regulatory networks, which sheds insight on the temporal dynamics of gene expression and regulatory interactions in biological systems.

Please remember that if no terms get enriched in an analysis there will be no table and plot for that specific setting. You may get a table or plot by tuning the parameters below.
